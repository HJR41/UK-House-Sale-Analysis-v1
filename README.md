# Project Outline
### 1. I have downloaded a csv of all Property Sales Data for UK property sales between 1995-2025 from Land Registry.gov.

 ### 2. I am in the process of doing a deep dive into the Data.

### 3. I am currently working within a test file,  using a sample of 70,000 transactions to refine my scripts.

### 4. Take a look at my Project Workbooks [here](2_Project).
