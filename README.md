# Project Outline
### 1. Project usesProperty Sales Data for UK property sales between 1995-2025 from HM Land Registry.gov.

 ### 2. I am in the process of doing a deep dive into the Data.

### 3. Currently working within a test file,  using a sample of 70,000 transactions to refine my scripts.

### 4. Take a look at my Project Workbooks [here](2_Project).

#### After initially working within a test file of 70_000 premises, the script runs extremely slowly, I will work on streamlining this to  speed things up in my project iterations.
