# Project Outline
### 1. I have downloaded a csv of all Property Sales Data for UK property sales between 1995-2025 from Land Registry.gov.

 ### 2. I am in the process of doing a deep dive into the Data.

### 3. I am currently working within a [test file](1_Tests)  using a sample of 1000 transactions to refine my scripts before run the scripts on the whole dataset within my [Project File](2_Project).
